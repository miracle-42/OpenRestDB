## Required software

Just two packages are missing:
* Java runtime environment
* A relational database

## Java

The package with Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
is called different on various distributions.

To install java in Ubuntu run

    apt install openjdk-19-jre

To install java on Red Hat run

    dnf install java-17-openjdk

To install java on Windows read the manual.

Other Linux/Unix distribution might use other names
and install method.

## PostgreSQL database

FutureForms can use both Oracle RDBMS and PostgreSQL as the
backend database. Only PostgreSQL is described here.

To install PostgreSQL in Ubuntu run

    apt install postgresql-server

To install PostgreSQL on Red Hat run

    dnf install postgresql-server

To install PostgreSQL on Windows read the manual.

When the database is installed a user and a database
has to be created. After that initial SQL data has
to be loaded.

A user has to be created. In this example the user is called `hr`
and the password is `hr`.

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER hr WITH PASSWORD 'hr'"

A database has to be created. In this example it is called `hr`
and the owner is the previously created `hr`.

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE hr WITH OWNER hr"

If the password is changed it also has to be changed in the
configuration file `conf/database/postgres.json`.
